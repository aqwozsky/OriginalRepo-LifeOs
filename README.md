## ✨ What is LifeOS?

**[LifeOS](https://github.com/aqwozsky/LifeOs)** is a modular, extensible system designed to evolve with its user.  
Think of it as a personal operating system simulation for tools, workflows, and automation.

This repository serves as the **official and original package source** for LifeOS.

- 📥 Hosting official LifeOS packages  
- 🧩 Acting as a package index / registry  
- ⚙️ Supporting package installation & updates  
- 🧪 Providing a base for future LifeOS tooling

This repo is intentionally minimal and will grow alongside LifeOS itself.
